## Joining

I (Prof. Nada Amin) am happy to brainstorm around shared interests.

**Harvard undergraduates**: I am happy to supervise research projects (CS91r, HCRP, KURE) or theses.

**Prospective PhD Students**: Please apply to SEAS and mention me in your application.

**Current Researchers** (PhD students, postdocs, faculty): I welcome collaboration and co-supervision opportunities.

**Members at large**: I am happy to engage as time permits.
